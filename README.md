# Digital_Image_Processing_UMass_Amherst
In this repository, you'll find the materials I use for ECE-566 Digital Image Processing at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass Amherst). It comprises slides and codes, and I'll be updating it throughout the semester.

This undergradute course is designed to cover very basic definitons in DIP moving to advanced approaches such as Neural Network-based segmentation and template matching.
