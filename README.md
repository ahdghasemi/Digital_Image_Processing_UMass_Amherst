# Digital Image Processing - UMass Amherst

Welcome to the `Digital Image Processing (DIP)` repository.  This repository contains essential materials for the DIP course that I taught as ECE-566 course at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass Amherst), including presentation slides and code implementations. Regular updates will be made throughout the semester to ensure you have access to the latest resources.

## Course Overview

This undergraduate course covers foundational concepts in Digital Image Processing (DIP) and progresses to advanced approaches, such as Neural Network-based segmentation and template matching.

## Contents

- **Slides**: Presentation slides complementing course lectures for a deeper understanding of DIP principles.
- **Code Implementations**: Practical examples reinforcing theoretical knowledge, spanning from basic concepts to advanced topics.

## Updates

The repository will be actively updated to provide additional resources, clarifications, and optimizations. Your feedback is valuable, so feel free to engage in discussions or raise issues if you have questions or suggestions.

Explore the materials and enjoy a comprehensive learning experience in Digital Image Processing!
